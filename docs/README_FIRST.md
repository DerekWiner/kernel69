# ðŸ§  README_FIRST.md â€“ Kernel69 Initialization

**Kernel69** is the ethical, cryptographic, and coordination core of the Alvearium OS.

This is the control node that validates all swarm processes using tamper-evident rituals, emotional alignment filters, and post-quantum cryptography.

Refer to `init_kernel69.py` to understand execution entry points. Manifestos and whitepapers define its governance and memory scaffolds.
